## :information_source: Getting Started

**The `easiest way to get the project up and running` :eyes: is to use Docker. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to follow**:

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your operating system.

2. Open the Docker application to ensure it's running.

3. Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
4. Create `.env` and pass variables.

5. Execute the command: `npm run init`

After completing the above steps, the project will be launched using Docker, including all necessary dependencies and services.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

- Docker & Docker Compose (for a containerized environment setup)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jeziorskilukasz/nestjs-boilerplate`

2. Install the dependencies: if you're using yarn: `yarn install` or if you prefer npm: `npm install`

3. Prepare your environment variables by copying the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the variables as per your project's requirements. Variables are validated so please make sure you have filled every key with proper value.

### Running the Application

For development mode: `npm run start:dev`

For production mode: `npm run start:prod`

### Using Docker Environment

Deploy the application in a Docker environment using the following command: `docker-compose up -d`

This command sets up the application and any required services (like databases, mail servers, etc.) as defined in your docker-compose.yml.

## :information_source: Scripts Overview

- `apiDocs:open` Opens the Swagger API documentation in your default browser.

- `build` Compiles the application into JavaScript.

- `format` Formats the source code using Prettier.

- `init` Performs initial setup tasks including building Docker images, running migrations, seeding the database, opening mail client for development, and opening API documentation.

- `lint` Runs ESLint to identify and fix code quality issues.

- `mailClient:open` Opens the local development mail client.

- `prisma:generate` Generates Prisma client.

- `prisma:studio` Opens Prisma Studio for database management.

- `push:run` Pushes the database schema changes using Prisma.

- `seed:run` Seeds the database with initial data using Prisma.

- `test`, `test:cov`, `test:debug`, `test:e2e`, `test:watch` Various scripts to run tests and generate coverage reports.

## :information_source: Docker Configuration Overview

The project uses Docker to run several services essential for its operation. Here is a basic overview of these services:

- **`API`**: The main service of the application, accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. It runs in development mode with hot code reloading.

- **`Redis`**: Used for caching, sessions, etc., available on port `6379`.

- **`Postgres`**: PostgreSQL database, available on port `5432`. Database data is persistently stored using Docker volumes.

- **`Maildev`**: Email testing tool, accessible at `http://localhost:<MAIL_CLIENT_PORT>`, where `<MAIL_CLIENT_PORT>` is defined in the `.env` file (in general 1080). It allows capturing and viewing emails sent by the application during development.

- **`PgAdmin`**: PostgreSQL UI, accessible at `http://localhost:5050`. It enables database management through a web interface.

### Prisma Studio

To open Prisma Studio, a tool for visualizing and managing database data, run the command `npx prisma studio` after starting the Docker services. It will be accessible at the address shown in the terminal, typically `http://localhost:5555`.

## :information_source: Important Commands

- `npm run start:dev` - Starts the application in development mode.

- `npm run docker:down` - Stops and removes Docker containers launched by `docker-compose up`.

## :file_folder: API Documentation

For local development navigate to http://localhost:3000/docs to view the Swagger UI, which provides detailed documentation and testing capabilities for your API.
